All code found inside “Program” folder. Please use provided makefile to compile. GCC
is required to compile. The makeomp makefile is for use on mac OSX, but is unlikely
to work on machines without modification (the gcc-6 would need to modified to suit
whatever version of gcc on the target machine).

The final report can be found inside the “Report” folder. There are 3 files in there (for the sake of completion), however the only relevant file is the .pdf file, which
contains the final report for the project.
